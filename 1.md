**What is Information System Auditing**  
process of examining the polcies and comparing it to what is practiced --- implemented..  example password policy vs implemented  
includes evidence gathering to verifying the efficacy of security controls  

Look at raw data and verify if it complies with policy  

**Why Audit** ?? to ensure CIA, to assess the efficacy of controls and ensure they are meeting the control objectives    
to demonstrate compliance with international standards  
to identify gaps, risks and areas for improvement  
to meet or renew iso cert  
to meet customer, regulatory or contractual/License requirements - specially ISO 27001 for Security.  
Increases trust and assurance  

ISO 27001 -- Information security management system
ISO 22301 -- Business continuity management system
ISO 9001 -- Quality management system  

**The IS Audting process**  
Gather evidence --> determine existing control efficacy(eg: is password enforcement effective)-->report on weak controls and remediation(current state vs desired state)  

**IS Audit Planning**  
Audit subjects -- location of subject and business process of the subject  
Audit objective -- why auditing ? what purpose ... payment processing and sensitive document retention  
Audit Scope -- what will be included in the audit ?  
Audit pre-planning -- risk assessment, compliance and timeframe  --- can refer to risk assessment done by others just to refer to 
Audit procedure -- create an audit program  

**Audit Procedures**  
Investigate --> inform  , are securit controls present, are they effective etc  
Obtain documentation  -- security policies, departmental policies, process procedures and workflows  
Regulatory compliance -- retention of specific doc, logs, transactions for a specific time  
Audit tools -- web app fuzzer, host vuln scanner  

**Isaca Code of Conduct** -- Information system audit and control association(ISACA)  
**ISACA auditing standards** -- risk based approach, audit report effective, ITAF - infor tech assurance framework  
1001 Audit charter -- like a pentest auth letter --- scope purpose and access to resources  
1006 proficiency -- continous edu, skills about the audited targtet systems  
and many others  
1401 - reporting  
1402 -- follow up activities  

**Organizational documentation**  
audit information gathering, ensure docs fall within audit scope, ensure docs are up-to-date  
Org charts, business processes - SOPs, tech, exisiting security controls  
network diagram, risk assessment reports - helps prioritize assets and threats  
past audit reports, products and services -- client business  
Oganizational security policies --- vp, email, social media, mobile device coverage, doc sharing and destruction, clean desk policy  
audit charter --- will help get these docs  
stakeholder needs --- audit subject, regulatory compliance pci/dss, gdpr etc  
Network diagrams --- building block should be in HLD/LLD  

**Security controls** -- response to mitigate/minimize/likelihood of risks  
Preventive controls --- firewall acl, door locks, guards, background checks, backupds  
detective controls -- alarm systems, ids, log file review, av, guards  
Corrective -- remediates risk -- backups, reimaging a failer server, patching a vulnerable host  
Detterant -- perimeter fencing, lighting, signage, video surveillance, guards  
Compensating --- complement any controls weakness, camera on top of guards  

Control objectives and controls --- Data avaiability, file transactions integrity, and data confidentiality  
example if control objective no more than 2 hours of data loss - backup every 1.5 hours  
weak or absent of controls result in failure to meet control objectives  
example --- forcepoint agent not filtering edge.exe  

Audit engagment --- statement of work, schedule, weekly meetings, timelines, urgent incident discovery, Audir report with evidence, remediation follow up  

### It Goverance  
framework of policies, processes and responsibilities to align IT solutions are in place to meet business objectives  
responsibility falls under board of directors and executive management  
example COBIT framwork from ISACA -- helps derive value from IT investments  
ITIL -- Info tech infra library -- IT service management best practices --service now, remedy -- incident, change management  
ISO 27001:2013 -- ISMS, vulnerabilities, risk assessment, periodic audits  -- 3 years 

Vulnerability -- weakness  
threat -- any event that harms or negative impact  
threat actor -- who is harming  
theat vector -- how they are gonna cause harm  theat vector -- via email, phishing is attack vector  
Risk management: likelihood of threat exploiting the vulnerability  
process of identification  of risk--> prioritizing --mitigation -- risk monitoring  

Enterprise Related risks -- market risk, credit risk, operatinal risk, compliance risk, environmental risk, strategic risk  
Risk Register --- central list of identified risks for business uint, with severity probability and impact, risk owner, risk mitigations  

**Risk Treatment**  -- mitigate sks to an acceptable level  
risk apetite -- Willingness to take risk  -- high risk apetite  start-up has high risk appetites  
risk capacity/threshold -- max risk can take  
risk tolerance -- is quantitative, operational short-term - defines limit or boundaries of the risk eg: 5% of customers can be affected  
it can be thought of range between apetite or capacity  
Each risk needs to be assigned to the risk owner - for traceability and accountatbility  

Risk acceptance -- risk is known, acceptable  eg:sha1 on cert  
Risk avoidance -- Risk unacceptable, to dis-engage in activity  eg: lecacy servers -- not giving it internet  
Risk Reduction -- putting in controls to reduce the impact/likelihood .. eg.. waf to prevent web attacks  
Risk transfer -- outsourcing -- Managed security services, insurance  
inherent risk --- risk there by default before putting controls -- eg- public facing site without waf  
residual risk --- risk that remains after controls -- eg - public site with waf -- zero day in waf  
Secondary risk --- new risk arising from controls --- eg risk of losing encryption key  

Business model for information security(BMIS)  - relationship between people tech and process  
Information technology assurance framework(ITAF) -- 
IT Balanced scorecard(IT BSC)  -- performance management system  


**The CIA Security TRIAD**  
whole objective of why we do security -- confidentiality, integrity and availability  
Confidentiality -- encryption, classification, IAM etc  
Integrity -- prevent tampering -- hashing - 1way function, digital signatures  
Availability -- clusters, redundancy, high availability load balancing  

Mandatory global standards 
**Personally Identifiable Information(PII)**  -- Anything that can uniquely identify an individual  
why -- privacy  
PII audit assurance review -- PII policy review, evaludate PII-related control efficacy  

**Protected health information(PHI)**  -- if information cannot be traced to an individual its not PHI  

**GDPR** General data protection regulation -- act of EU, puts control of personal data into users hands, collection retection location etc  

**PCI DSS** --- payment card industry data security standard -- how to process cardholder data  

**Health insurance portability and accountability act(HIPAA)** - law designed to protect sensitive patient health from disclosure without consent  
**Federal risk and authorization management program(FedRAMP)** --cloud migration - azure, aws, gcp -  FIPS recommends hashing ency protocols  

**Assets and Risks**  
asset is anything of value - file, employee, server etc  
identify risks and identify controls  
IT Asset lifecycle --- planning/procurement, deployment, operations support, decommisioning  

**Risk calculations**  
Exposure factor-EF -- % of asset affected by single negative incident  
Single LOSS expectancy(SLE) -- cost assiociated with a single negative incident == AV asset valueXEF  
Annual rate of occurance(ARO) -- negative incidents per year  
Annualized Loss Expectancy -ALE --- ARO X SLE
