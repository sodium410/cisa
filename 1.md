Regulatory compliance -- retention of specific doc, logs, transactions for a specific time  
Audit tools -- web app fuzzer, host vuln scanner

**Security controls** -- response to mitigate/minimize/likelihood of risks  
Preventive controls --- firewall acl, door locks, guards, background checks, backupds  
detective controls -- alarm systems, ids, log file review, av, guards  
Corrective -- remediates risk -- backups, reimaging a failer server, patching a vulnerable host  
Detterant -- perimeter fencing, lighting, signage, video surveillance, guards
